README

0. Unzip - should have done this to see this file... 

1. Place Lib folder and, if you dont have one, the burp.ini file in the same dir as burp.jar file (burp root)

2. Move the jython-standalone-2.7.0.jar file to a directory of your choosing and point burp to it from within burp (Extender -> Options -> Python Environment -> Location of Jython standalone JAR file:).

3. Add the file from 'Lib/burp_extender.py' to the extender (Extender -> Extensions -> Add).

4. Should load with some Java conversation in the error tab. You should now see the 'Jython Console' tab in burp.

5. See 'Example_Usages' for some ideas...

6. Enjoy being creative
